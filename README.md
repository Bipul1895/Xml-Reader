# Xml-Reader
Reads xml data from provided URL and parses the data to display it in a List View. 
Currently the application is created to read XML data from apple's rss feed. It can be easily extended to read other XML data. 
Concepts Used : 1) Async Task : For reading data from the provided URL and stores it in the form of a string.
                2) Xml Pull Parser : It is used to parse xml data by identifying Start tag, End tag and text. 
                3) List View : Ultimately, the parsed data is displayed in a ListView.
